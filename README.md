# CausalModels
Time to delve into Causality *gold standard* of Data Analysis

After many months into prediction aspect of statistcs and Machine Learning (supervised and unsupervised) its time to call it "causal"

 Know the difference between prediction and causal analysis

Causal Analysis, for beginners like me can be difficult and tricky to understand
especially when you come from a space of feature variables and fitting,predicting and optimizing models.

I will be starting with [causality](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/causality/0.0.3) package in Python as only that had a documentation with example to follow.

GOAL:

1. I want to make a trend flow metric and determine if there is a popularity of some concept/video when a certain part of the world watches it. Like is there a flow of trends from western culture to other parts of the world.
I began with [Youtube](http://dataglee.pythonanywhere.com/Youtube) - all I can see is MS:Dhoni trailer is popular in places around India and Australia and USA top trends always have something in common.
